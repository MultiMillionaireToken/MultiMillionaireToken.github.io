**Multi Millionaire Token** or **MMT** is a new decentralized digital currency with a fixed supply of **2,000,000** coins . Created in late july 2021 by a small team of **mathematicians** and **AI experts** from Cambridge, this new token uses the ethereum blockchain  to deliver secure transactions.

# Token Features

1) The token has a fixed limited supply of only **2,000,000** tokens. No more worrying about inflation.

2) The founding team consists of **mathematicians** and **AI experts** from Cambridge, UK. 

3) **MMT** runs as an **ERC-20** [smart contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f20e5880d8896ece03a690328a16cafe88c6e88) on the popular and secure ethereum blockchain. 

4) Moonshot potential: the value of the MMT is not tied to any currency and can go up in value, **to the moon** (the value of MMT can also go down).
